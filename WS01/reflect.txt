In this workshop we focused mainly on the handling of modules in C++, 
creating .cpp and .h files with the definition and declaration of the 
functions. In this way, the program logics were separated in different 
modules (files, graphics, io and students). The correct import of these
modules was also done so that the logic can be used in other parts of 
the code.

The most complicated thing was to understand how to import one module
into another and the correct use of the namespace.
