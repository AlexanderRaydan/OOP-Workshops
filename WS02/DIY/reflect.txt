In this workshop we worked on file management (reading) and extracting the 
information and placing it in a structure (Assessment). Being able to create 
functions that have the same name but receive different parameters and have 
different logics depending (read function).  Free memory in structures using 
the "delete" function. 

And finally in the "DIY" section dynamic memory management 
in structures and their variables, creating new memory sections using the "new" 
function followed by the data type to set the size of the memory space.
