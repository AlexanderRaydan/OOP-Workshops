In completing this workshop, I've learned the fundamentals of object-oriented programming 
in C++. This includes creating classes with member variables and functions, implementing 
constructors and destructors, and effectively using input validation techniques.

One of the key takeaways is understanding how to organize code by defining classes with 
data and behavior. Input validation has been emphasized to prevent unexpected errors from 
invalid user input, enhancing the robustness of the program.

While there were some challenges in implementing complex logic and ensuring code correctness, 
experimentation, debugging, and reference to course materials helped overcome these difficulties.

Overall, this workshop has strengthened my understanding of OOP concepts and improved my 
proficiency in C++ programming, providing valuable skills for developing robust and 
maintainable software solutions.
