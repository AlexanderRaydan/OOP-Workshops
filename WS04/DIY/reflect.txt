Throughout this workshop, I delved into essential concepts of object-oriented 
programming in C++, primarily focusing on constructors, destructors, modifiers, 
and queries within a class. Constructors allowed me to initialize objects, 
providing default values and setting up dynamic memory allocation as needed. 
Destructors, on the other hand, ensured proper cleanup of resources, preventing 
memory leaks and maintaining program efficiency.

Modifiers enabled me to modify the state of objects, whether by changing member 
variables or reallocating dynamic memory. This functionality was crucial for 
implementing features like adding, modifying, or removing elements within a class. 
Additionally, queries provided methods to retrieve information or perform checks 
on object attributes, enhancing the versatility and usability of the class.
