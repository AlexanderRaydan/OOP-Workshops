I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

One of the key topics covered in the workshop was the override of operators. 
Understanding when to use the override in a member function versus a helper 
function was initially challenging for me. Specifically, discerning in which 
cases to implement an operator overload as a member function and in which cases 
to utilize a helper function was a bit difficult.

To overcome this difficulty, I delved deeper into the course notes, paying close 
attention to the examples provided. Additionally, I conducted experiments with my 
own code, implementing different approaches to operator overloading. Through this 
hands-on practice and thorough analysis, I gradually gained clarity on the 
distinction between member functions and helper functions for operator overrides.
