Authenticity Declaration:

I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

During the workshop, I tackled essential object-oriented programming concepts such 
as Copy Constructor, Copy Assignment Operator, Friend Class, Constructor, and Destructor. 
Initially, grasping their nuances proved challenging, particularly in discerning when 
and how to employ each effectively. Through practical experimentation and careful analysis 
of examples, I gradually gained clarity on their applications.

For instance, understanding the significance of Copy Constructor and Copy Assignment Operator 
in managing object copies and the utility of Friend Classes in controlled access to 
private members were key takeaways. Similarly, mastering the role of Constructors 
and Destructors in initializing and deallocating resources contributed to a more 
comprehensive understanding of class design and object lifecycle management. 
Through iterative refinement of code and hands-on practice, I honed my skills in 
implementing these concepts in real-world scenarios, ultimately bolstering my proficiency 
in object-oriented programming.
