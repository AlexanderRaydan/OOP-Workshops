During the workshop, I focused on incorporating date functionalities into 
class structures effectively. Initially, understanding how to manage date-related
data within classes posed a challenge. However, as I progressed, I grasped the 
importance of encapsulation and abstraction in organizing date information.

Implementing methods to handle date components and format date output highlighted
the significance of encapsulating data and behavior within classes. Additionally,
integrating date functionalities into existing classes underscored the flexibility
of object-oriented design principles.

Through rigorous testing and debugging, I ensured the accuracy and consistency 
of date calculations across different scenarios. Overall, the workshop enhanced 
my understanding of class design and object-oriented programming principles, 
particularly in managing date-related data effectively.
