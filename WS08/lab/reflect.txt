In Workshop #8, I focused on implementing abstract base classes and derived classes 
in C++, exploring concepts like polymorphism and inheritance. Understanding abstract
classes and pure virtual functions initially posed a challenge, but as I progressed, 
I grasped their importance in creating flexible class hierarchies.

The implementation of the iAccount interface as an abstract base class provided a 
blueprint for creating different types of accounts with shared functionalities. By 
defining pure virtual functions, I learned how to enforce a common interface for 
derived classes.

I also explored inheritance by deriving classes like ChequingAccount and SavingsAccount 
from the Account base class. This allowed for specialized functionality while maintaining 
consistency through polymorphism.
