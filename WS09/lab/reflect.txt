Focused on implementing classes for managing library items and books in C++. Key concepts 
explored included copy constructors, copy assignment operators, dynamic memory management, 
and polymorphism.

The provided code demonstrated proper implementation of copy constructors and copy assignment
operators to ensure correct duplication of object data, especially for dynamically allocated memory.

Memory management was highlighted through the implementation of destructors and manual 
deallocation of dynamically allocated memory, essential for preventing memory leaks and 
managing resources efficiently.
